GSP076

This lab from [Google Cloud Skills Boost](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/focuses/581?parent=catalog) gives an introductory, end-to-end experience of training and prediction on AI Platform. The lab will use a census dataset to:

- Create a TensorFlow 2.x training application and validate it locally.
- Run your training job on a single worker instance in the cloud.
- Deploy a model to support prediction.
- Request an online prediction and see the response.
